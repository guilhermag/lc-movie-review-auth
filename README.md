- Auth API running on port: 3000(default).
  - It's possible to change the default ports, just make sure to change in the project files.
  - The installation of the Auth API is documented in the respective repository.
- Docker running in background with the Postgres container, instructions ahead.
  - It's possible not use docker, just make sure to put the correct db link on the ```.env``` file.
